title:: Cellular networks (UMTS/LTE/5G)

- 5G
	- New radio communication techniques and spectrum
	- Support for device to device communications (D2D)
	- Improved performance
		- Theoretical latency in single digit ms
		- Bandwidth in gbps range
		- Ability to provide connectivity in fast moving vehicles
		- Enables more dense connectivity and scalability (more devices)
