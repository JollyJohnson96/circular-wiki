- Definition
	- “A circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by 
	  intention and design. It replaces the ‘end-of-life’ concept with restoration, shifts towards 
	  the use of renewable energy, eliminates the use of toxic chemicals, which impair reuse, 
	  and aims for the elimination of waste through the superior design of materials, 
	  products, systems, and, within this, business models.”
